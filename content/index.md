# Welcome to My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

Hey there! You've stumbled upon my digital gardenâ€”a space where I cultivate and share my thoughts, discoveries, and ongoing learnings.

## What You'll Find Here

This garden is a collection of [[interconnected notes]], growing and evolving over time. Unlike traditional blogs, these notes are:

- Living documents that evolve as my understanding deepens
- Interconnected through bi-directional links
- Sometimes polished, sometimes raw works in progress

## Recent Explorations

Here are some areas I've been thinking about lately:
- [[Research Topic 1]]
- [[Project Notes]]
- [[Book Summaries]]

## Navigation

- Use the graph view to explore connections
- Click on double-bracketed links to navigate between notes
- Use the search bar to find specific topics

## About Me

A bit about who I am and what I'm working on. Feel free to [[reach out]] if you'd like to connect!

## Digital Garden Philosophy

This space follows the [[digital garden]] philosophy of learning in public. Notes are living documents that grow and evolve over time.
